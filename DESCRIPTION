Title: Vault Client for Secrets and Sensitive Data
Version: 1.0.2
Description: Provides an interface to a 'HashiCorp' vault server over
  its http API (typically these are self-hosted; see

  certificates.  Authentication with vault is supported through
  several backends including user name/password and authentication via
