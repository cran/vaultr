\title{Vault Client for Secrets and Sensitive Data}
\description{
Vault client for secrets and sensitive data; this package provides
wrappers for HashiCorp's \href{https://vaultproject.io}{vault
server}.  The package wraps most of the high-level API, and
includes support for authentication via a number of backends
(tokens, username and password, github, and "AppRole"), as well as
a number of secrets engines (two key-value stores, vault's
cubbyhole and the transit backend for encryption-as-a-service).
}
\details{
To get started, you might want to start with the "vaultr"
vignette, available from the package with
\code{vignette("vaultr")}.

The basic design of the package is that it has very few
entrypoints - for most uses one will interact almost entirely with
the \code{\link{vault_client}} function.  That function returns an
R6 object with several methods (functions) but also several
objects that themselves contain more methods and objects, creating
a nested tree of functionality.

From any object, online help is available via the help method, for
example
\preformatted{
client <- vaultr::vault_client()
client$secrets$transit$help()
}

For testing packages that rely on vault, there is support for
creating temporary vault servers; see
\code{\link{vault_test_server}} and the "packages" vignette.
